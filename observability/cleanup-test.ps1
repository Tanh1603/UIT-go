.SYNOPSIS
    Cleanup script for interrupted or failed performance tests

.DESCRIPTION
    This script cleans up all artifacts from interrupted k6 performance tests:
    - Ghost drivers in Redis
    - Real test drivers/users in Redis
    - MQTT connections (if any are stuck)
    - Optionally: Test users/drivers from Clerk/Database

.PARAMETER KeepGhosts
    Keep ghost drivers in Redis (only clean real test data)

.PARAMETER DeepClean
    Also attempt to clean test users/drivers from database (requires manual confirmation)

.PARAMETER FlushRedis
    Completely flush all Redis data (WARNING: Nuclear option)

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-test.ps1
    Basic cleanup - removes all drivers from Redis

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-test.ps1 -KeepGhosts
    Removes only real test drivers, keeps ghost drivers

.EXAMPLE
    .\cleanup-test.ps1 -FlushRedis
    Complete Redis reset (use with caution)
